# TaskFlowAGI - Journey into Autonomous Agents 🚀  

Welcome to **TaskFlowAGI**, my personal learning space where I explore **autonomous agents, function management, and automated workflows**. This project is a hands-on journey into **how AI can break down tasks, execute them intelligently, and improve over time**—all while keeping things **lightweight and modular**.  

I'm documenting my progress, key learnings, and experiments along the way. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer curious about BabyAGI, feel free to follow along!

## 🌟 Learning Goals  
This repository is structured around **three main pillars**:  

### 📌 1. Basic Function Management  
- 🛠 **Hands-on:** Implement a function manager that registers, modifies, and executes tasks dynamically.  

### 🤖 2. Self-Building Agents  
- 🛠 **Hands-on:** Build an agent that **analyzes tasks, improves its approach, and executes Python functions dynamically**.  

### ⚙️ 3. Function & Automated Workflows  
- 🛠 **Hands-on:** Design an AI-driven **task execution pipeline that automates workflows based on real-world inputs**.
